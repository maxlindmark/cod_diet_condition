# Historical cod diet and feeding and spatiotemporal analysis of condition

This repo contains R code for analyzing diet and stomach contents, as well as body condition of cod.

We use Spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed-effects models and a predictive-modeling framework within the R package [sdmTMB](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB). This repository contains (some) data and all code used for analyses and figures from Lindmark & Casini (20XX).

**Authors:** [Max Lindmark](https://maxlindmark.netlify.app/) and [Michele Casini](https://www.slu.se/cv/michele-casini/)
